IMPORTANCE OF LEARNING DEVOPS ENGINEERING IN SDLC

I remember you (professor) mentioning that DevOps is a culture; I have also seen it written in many other places online as well. 

DevOps is important in SDLC mainly due to its' efficiency in taking multiple code changes from different engineers, and being able to test and deploy on a bigger scale continuously.
