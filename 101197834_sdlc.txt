IMPORTANCE OF LEARNING DEVOPS ENGINEERING IN SDLC

I remember you (professor) mentioning that DevOps is a culture; I have also seen it written in many other places online as well. 

DevOps is important in SDLC mainly due to its' efficiency in taking multiple code changes from different engineers, and being able
 to test and deploy on a bigger scale continuously. 


In more technical terms (Source: https://helicaltech.com/what-is-devops-in-sdlc/):
DevOps is a software development method that emphasizes communication, collaboration (information sharing and web service usage), 
integration, automation, and measurement of cooperation between software developers and other IT professionals.[1][2] The method 
acknowledges the interdependence of software development, quality assurance (QA), and IT operations, and aims to help an organization
rapidly produce software products and services and to improve operations performance.
